"several species are found in the temperate zone, and one species, the galápagos penguin, lives near the equator.",1
"the smallest penguin species is the little blue penguin (eudyptula minor), also known as the fairy penguin, which stands around 33 cm (13 in) tall and weighs 1 kg (2.2 lb).",0
"when european explorers discovered what are today known as penguins in the southern hemisphere, they noticed their similar appearance to the great auk of the northern hemisphere, and named them after this bird, although they are not closely related.the etymology of the word penguin is still debated.",0
"support for this etymology can be found in the alternative germanic word for penguin, fettgans or ""fat-goose"", and the related dutch word vetgans.",1
"since 1871, the latin word pinguinus has been used in scientific classification to name the genus of the great auk (pinguinus impennis, meaning ""penguin without flight feathers""), which became extinct in the mid-19th century.",1
"as confirmed by a 2004 genetic study, the genus pinguinus belongs in the family of the auks (alcidae), within the order of the charadriiformes.the birds currently known as penguins were discovered later and were so named by sailors because of their physical resemblance to the great auk.",0
"despite this resemblance, however, they are not auks and they are not closely related to the great auk.",1
they were classified in 1831 by bonaparte in several distinct genera within the family spheniscidae and order sphenisciformes.,0
"some sources consider the white-flippered penguin a separate eudyptula species, while others treat it as a subspecies of the little blue penguin; the actual situation seems to be more complicated.",1
"madrynornis (puerto madryn late miocene of argentina)the early oligocene genus cruschedula was formerly thought to belong to spheniscidae; however, re-examination of the holotype in 1943 resulted in the genus being placed in accipitridae.",1
"although penguin bones of any one species vary much in size and few good specimens are known, the alpha taxonomy of many prehistoric forms still leaves much to be desired.",0
"some seminal articles about penguin prehistory have been published since 2005, the evolution of the living genera can be considered resolved by now.",1
"what can be said as certainly as possible in the absence of direct (i.e., fossil) evidence is that, by the end of the cretaceous, the penguin lineage must have been evolutionarily well distinct, though much less so morphologically; it is fairly likely that they were not yet entirely flightless at that time, as flightless birds have generally low resilience to the breakdown of trophic webs that follows the initial phase of mass extinctions because of their below-average dispersal capabilities (see also flightless cormorant).",1
"the oldest known fossil penguin species is waimanu manneringi, which lived in the early paleocene epoch of new zealand, or about 62 mya.",0
"but size plasticity seems to have been great at this initial stage of penguin radiation: on seymour island, antarctica, for example, around 10 known species of penguins ranging in size from medium to huge apparently coexisted some 35 mya during the priabonian (late eocene).",0
"it is not even known whether the gigantic palaeeudyptines constitute a monophyletic lineage, or whether gigantism was evolved independently in a much restricted palaeeudyptinae and the anthropornithinae – whether they were considered valid, or whether there was a wide size range present in the palaeeudyptinae as delimited as is usually done these days (i.e., including anthropornis nordenskjoeldi).",1
"the oldest well-described giant penguin, the 5-foot (1.5 m)-tall icadyptes salasi, actually occurred as far north as northern peru about 36 mya.",0
"their decline and disappearance coincided with the spread of the squalodontoidea and other primitive, fish-eating toothed whales, which certainly competed with them for food, and were ultimately more successful.",0
"presumably diverging from other penguins around 40 mya, it seems that the spheniscinae were for quite some time limited to their ancestral area, as the well-researched deposits of the antarctic peninsula and patagonia have not yielded paleogene fossils of the subfamily.",0
this genus has a distribution centred on the antarctic coasts and barely extends to some subantarctic islands today.,1
"pygoscelis contains species with a fairly simple black-and-white head pattern; their distribution is intermediate, centred on antarctic coasts but extending somewhat northwards from there.",1
"as the former genus, pygoscelis seems to have diverged during the bartonian, but the range expansion and radiation that led to the present-day diversity probably did not occur until much later; around the burdigalian stage of the early miocene, roughly 20–15 mya.the genera spheniscus and eudyptula contain species with a mostly subantarctic distribution centred on south america; some, however, range quite far northwards.",0
the emergence of most of today's subantarctic penguin species almost certainly was caused by this sequence of neogene climate shifts.,0
penguin ancestry beyond waimanu remains unknown and not well-resolved by molecular or morphological analyses.,1
"the latter tend to be confounded by the strong adaptive autapomorphies of the sphenisciformes; a sometimes perceived fairly close relationship between penguins and grebes is almost certainly an error based on both groups' strong diving adaptations, which are homoplasies.",0
"what seems clear is that penguins belong to a clade of neoaves (living birds except for paleognaths and fowl) that comprises what is sometimes called ""higher waterbirds"" to distinguish them from the more ancient waterfowl.",1
"some think the penguin-like plotopterids (usually considered relatives of cormorants and anhingas) may actually be a sister group of the penguins and those penguins may have ultimately shared a common ancestor with the pelecaniformes and consequently would have to be included in that order, or that the plotopterids were not as close to other pelecaniforms as generally assumed, which would necessitate splitting the traditional pelecaniformes into three.a 2014 analysis of whole genomes of 48 representative bird species has concluded that penguins are the sister group of procellariiformes, from which they diverged about 60 million years ago (95% ci, 56.8-62.7).the distantly related puffins, which live in the north pacific and north atlantic, developed similar characteristics to survive in the arctic and sub-arctic environments.",0
"in the water, however, penguins are astonishingly agile.",1
the emperor penguin has a maximum feather density of about nine feathers per square centimeter which is actually much lower than other birds that live in antarctic environments.,1
"however, they have been identified as having at least four different types of feather: in addition to the traditional feather, the emperor has afterfeathers, plumules, and filoplumes.",0
they often huddle together to keep warm and rotate positions to make sure that each penguin gets a turn in the centre of the heat pack.,0
"isabelline penguins tend to live shorter lives than normal penguins, as they are not well-camouflaged against the deep and are often passed over as mates.",1
"in fact, only a few species of penguin actually live so far south.",1
"several species live in the temperate zone; one, the galápagos penguin, lives as far north as the galápagos islands, but this is only made possible by the cold, rich waters of the antarctic humboldt current that flows around these islands.",1
several authors have suggested that penguins are a good example of bergmann's rule where larger-bodied populations live at higher latitudes than smaller-bodied populations.,0
"there is some disagreement about this and several other authors have noted that there are fossil penguin species that contradict this hypothesis and that ocean currents and upwellings are likely to have had a greater effect on species diversity than latitude alone.major populations of penguins are found in angola, antarctica, argentina, australia, chile, namibia, new zealand, and south africa.",1
"penguins for the most part breed in large colonies, the exceptions being the yellow-eyed and fiordland species; these colonies may range in size from as few as 100 pairs for gentoo penguins to several hundred thousand in the case of king, macaroni and chinstrap penguins.",0
"agonistic displays are those intended to confront or drive off, or alternately appease and avoid conflict with, other individuals.penguins form monogamous pairs for a breeding season, though the rate the same pair recouples varies drastically.",0
"some yolk often remains when a chick is born, and is thought to help sustain the chick if the parents are delayed in returning with food.when emperor penguin mothers lose a chick, they sometimes attempt to ""steal"" another mother's chick, usually unsuccessfully as other females in the vicinity assist the defending mother in keeping her chick.",1
penguins have no special fear of humans and will often approach groups of people.,0
"dogs preyed upon penguins while they were allowed in antarctica during the age of early human exploration as sled dogs, but dogs have long since been banned from antarctica.",0
their black-and-white plumage is often likened to a white tie suit.,0
"several remakes and enhanced editions have followed, most recently in 2012. penguins are also sometimes depicted in music.in 1941, dc comics introduced the avian-themed character of the penguin as a supervillain adversary of the superhero batman (detective comics #58).",1
"several pro, minor, college and high school sport teams in the united states have named themselves after the species, including the pittsburgh penguins team in the national hockey league and the youngstown state penguins in college athletics.",0
"the united states of america (u.s.a. or usa), commonly known as the united states (u.s. or us) or america, is a country primarily located in north america.",1
"in the late 18th century, the u.s. began expanding across north america, gradually obtaining new territories, sometimes through war, frequently displacing native americans, and admitting new states.",1
"the first known use of the name ""america"" dates back to 1507, when it appeared on a world map produced by the german cartographer martin waldseemüller in the french city of saint-dié-des-vosges.",1

"the first known publication of the phrase ""united states of america"" was in an anonymous essay in the virginia gazette newspaper in williamsburg, on april 6, 1776.the second draft of the articles of confederation, prepared by john dickinson and completed no later than june 17, 1776, declared ""the name of this confederation shall be the 'united states of america'.""",0
"it has been generally accepted that the first inhabitants of north america migrated from siberia by way of the bering land bridge and arrived at least 12,000 years ago; however, some evidence suggests an even earlier date of arrival.",0
"the spanish set up the first settlements in florida and new mexico, such as saint augustine, often considered the nation's oldest city, and santa fe.",1

"tensions with britain remained, however, leading to the war of 1812, which was fought to a draw.",1
"nevertheless, as casualties mounted after 1863 and lincoln delivered his emancipation proclamation, the main purpose of the war from the union's viewpoint became the abolition of slavery.",0
"indeed, when the union ultimately won the war in april 1865, each of the states in the defeated south was required to ratify the thirteenth amendment, which prohibited slavery except as penal labor.",1
