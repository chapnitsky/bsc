sweden and gothia were two separate nations long before that and since antiquity.,0
it is not known how long they existed: the epic poem beowulf describes semi-legendary swedish-geatish wars in the sixth century.,1
"between 800 and 1000, trade brought an abundance of silver to gotland, and according to some scholars, the gotlanders of this era hoarded more silver than the rest of the population of scandinavia combined.st ansgar is usually credited with introducing christianity in 829, but the new religion did not begin to fully replace paganism until the 12th century.",1

"slavery (also called thralldom) was not common in sweden, and what slavery there was tended to be driven out of existence thanks to the spread of christianity as well as to the difficulty to obtain slaves from the lands east of the baltic sea, and by the development of cities before the 16th century.",1
"indeed, both slavery and serfdom were abolished altogether by a decree of king magnus iv in 1335. former slaves tended to be absorbed into the peasantry, and some became labourers in the towns.",1
"however, margaret's successors, whose rule was also centred in denmark, were unable to control the swedish nobility.",0
"king christian ii of denmark, who asserted his claim to sweden by force of arms, ordered a massacre of swedish nobles in stockholm in 1520. this came to be known as the ""stockholm blood bath"" and stirred the swedish nobility to new resistance and, on 6 june (now sweden's national holiday) in 1523, they made gustav vasa their king.",0

"famine also hit sweden, killing roughly 10% of sweden's population.the swedes conducted a series of invasions into the polish–lithuanian commonwealth, known as the deluge.",0
"russia, the most serious threat to sweden at this time, had a larger army but lagged far behind in both equipment and training.after the battle of narva in 1700, one of the first battles of the great northern war, the russian army was so severely devastated that sweden had an open chance to invade russia.",0
"however, charles xii did not pursue the russian army, instead turning against poland–lithuania and defeating the polish king, augustus ii the strong, and his saxon allies at the battle of kliszów in 1702. this gave russia time to rebuild and modernise its army.",0

"nevertheless, sweden remained poor, retaining a nearly entirely agricultural economy even as denmark and western european countries began to industrialise.",1
"because the swedish peasantry had never been enserfed as elsewhere in europe, the swedish farming culture began to take on a critical role in swedish politics, which has continued through modern times with modern agrarian party (now called the centre party).",0
"however, sweden supported norwegian resistance against germany, and in 1943 helped rescue danish jews from deportation to nazi concentration camps.",0
"during the last year of the war, sweden began to play a role in humanitarian efforts, and many refugees, among them several thousand jews from nazi-occupied europe, were rescued thanks to the swedish rescue missions to internment camps and partly because sweden served as a haven for refugees, primarily from the nordic countries and the baltic states.",0
"nevertheless, both swedes and others have argued that sweden could have done more to oppose the nazis' war efforts, even if it meant increasing the risk of occupation.",1
"during the 1960s the efta countries were often referred to as the outer seven, as opposed to the inner six of the then-european economic community (eec).sweden, like many industrialised countries, entered a period of economic decline and upheaval following the oil embargoes of 1973–74 and 1978–79.",0

"the provinces are usually grouped together in three large lands, parts, the northern norrland, the central svealand and southern götaland.",1

"in southern sweden, narrower rivers known as åar are also common.",0
"the winter in the far south is usually weak and is manifested only through some shorter periods with snow and sub-zero temperatures, autumn may well turn into spring there, without a distinct period of winter.",0
the warmest summers usually happen in the mälaren valley around stockholm due to the vast landmass shielding the middle east coast from atlantic low-pressure systems in july compared to the south and west.,1
"north of the arctic circle, the sun never sets for part of each summer, and it never rises for part of each winter.",1
"the highest temperature ever recorded in sweden was 38 °c (100 °f) in målilla in 1947, while the coldest temperature ever recorded was −52.6 °c (−62.7 °f) in vuoggatjålme on 2 february 1966. temperatures expected in sweden are heavily influenced by the large fennoscandian landmass, as well as continental europe and western russia, which allows hot or cool inland air to be easily transported to sweden.",0
"that, in turn, renders most of sweden's southern areas having warmer summers than almost everywhere in the nearby british isles, even matching temperatures found along the continental atlantic coast as far south as in northern spain.",0
"in winter, however, the same high-pressure systems sometimes put the entire country far below freezing temperatures.",1
there is some maritime moderation from the atlantic which renders the swedish continental climate less severe than that of nearby russia.,1
"apart from the ice-free atlantic bringing marine air into sweden tempering winters, the mildness is further explained by prevailing low-pressure systems postponing winter, with the long nights often staying above freezing in the south of the country due to the abundant cloud cover.",1
an example is that the coldest ever month (january 1987) in stockholm was also the sunniest january month on record.the relative strength of low and high-pressure systems of marine and continental air also define the highly variable summers.,1
"the bare mountain zonesouthern deciduous forest zone, also known as the nemoral region, the southern deciduous forest zone is a part of a larger vegetation zone which also includes denmark and large parts of central europe.",0
they tend to grow too quickly due to being outside of their native range and large distances between the tree rings cause poor board quality.,1
"during the last 40–50 years large areas of former spruce plantings have been replanted with deciduous forest.southern coniferous forest zone, also known as the boreo-nemoral region, the southern coniferous forest zone is delimited by the oak's northern natural limit (limes norrlandicus) and the spruce's southern natural limit, between the southern deciduous zone and the taiga farther north.",1
birch grows largely everywhere.,0

"sweden has four fundamental laws (swedish: grundlagar) which together form the constitution: the instrument of government (swedish: regeringsformen), the act of succession (swedish: successionsordningen), the freedom of the press act (swedish: tryckfrihetsförordningen), and the fundamental law on freedom of expression (swedish: yttrandefrihetsgrundlagen).the public sector in sweden is divided into two parts: the legal person known as the state (swedish: staten) and local authorities: the latter include regional county councils (swedish: landsting) and local municipalities (swedish: kommuner).",1
"notwithstanding their self-rule, local authorities are nevertheless in practice interdependent upon the state, as the parameters of their responsibilities and the extent of their jurisdiction are specified in the local government act (swedish: kommunallagen) passed by the riksdag.sweden is a constitutional monarchy, and king carl xvi gustaf is the head of state, but the role of the monarch is limited to ceremonial and representative functions.",0
"general elections are held every four years, on the second sunday of september.",0
"the swedish social democratic party has played a leading role in swedish politics since 1917, after the reformists had confirmed their strength and the left-wing revolutionaries formed their own party.",1
"only five general elections since world war ii—1976, 1979, 1991, 2006 and 2010—have given the assembled bloc of centre-right parties enough seats in the riksdag to form a government.",1
"in the 2010 general election the alliance contended against a unified left block consisting of the social democrats, the greens and the left party.",1
"nevertheless, neither the alliance, nor the left block, chose to form a coalition with the sweden democrats.the outcome of the 2014 general election resulted in the attainment of more seats by the three centre-left parties in comparison to the centre-right alliance for sweden, with the two blocs receiving 159 and 141 seats respectively.",1
"on 3 october 2014, stefan löfven formed a minority government consisting of the social democrats and the greens.election turnout in sweden has always been high by international comparison.",1
"although it declined in recent decades, the latest elections saw an increase in voter turnout (80.11% in 2002, 81.99% in 2006, 84.63% in 2010, 85.81 in 2014) and 87.18% in 2018. swedish politicians enjoyed a high degree of confidence from the citizens in the 1960s, however, that level of confidence has since declined steadily, and is now at a markedly lower level than in its scandinavian neighbours.",0
every region corresponds to a county (län) with a number of municipalities per county.,1
both levels have legislative assemblies (municipal councils and region assemblies of between 31 and 101 members (always an uneven number) that are elected from party-list proportional representation at the general election which are held every four years in conjunction with the national parliamentary elections.,1
the actual age of the kingdom of sweden is unknown.,1
"however, historians usually start the line of swedish monarchs from when svealand and götaland were ruled under the same king, namely eric the victorious (geat) and his son olof skötkonung in the tenth century.",0
"these events are often described as the consolidation of sweden, although substantial areas were conquered and incorporated later.",1
"as a reaction to the failed great northern war, a parliamentary system was introduced in 1719, followed by three different flavours of constitutional monarchy in 1772, 1789 and 1809, the latter granting several civil liberties.",1
"already during the first of those three periods, the 'era of liberty' (1719–72) the swedish rikstag had developed into a very active parliament, and this tradition continued into the nineteenth century, laying the basis for the transition towards modern democracy at the end of that century.in 1866 sweden became a constitutional monarchy with a bicameral parliament, with the first chamber indirectly elected by local governments, and the second chamber directly elected in national elections every four years.",0
"the global gender gap report 2006 ranked sweden as the number one country in terms of gender equality.some swedish political figures have become known worldwide, among these are: raoul wallenberg, folke bernadotte, the former secretary-general of the united nations dag hammarskjöld, the former prime minister olof palme, the former prime minister and later foreign minister carl bildt, the former president of the general assembly of the united nations jan eliasson, and the former international atomic energy agency iraq inspector hans blix.",0

"the decrease in the number of swedish prisoners was considered ""out-of-the-ordinary"" by the head of sweden's prison and probation services, with prison numbers in sweden falling by around 1% a year since 2004. prisons were closed in the towns of åby, håja, båtshagen, and kristianstad.",0
sweden's government pursued an independent course of nonalignment in times of peace so that neutrality would be possible in the event of war.sweden's doctrine of neutrality is often traced back to the 19th century as the country has not been in a state of war since the end of the swedish campaign against norway in 1814. during world war ii sweden joined neither the allied nor axis powers.,1
"this has sometimes been disputed since in effect sweden allowed in select cases the nazi regime to use its railroad system to transport troops and goods, especially iron ore from mines in northern sweden, which was vital to the german war machine.",1
"however, sweden also indirectly contributed to the defence of finland in the winter war, and permitted the training of norwegian and danish troops in sweden after 1943.",0
later investigations revealed that the plane was actually gathering information for nato.,0

the high coverage of collective agreements is achieved despite the absence of state mechanisms extending collective agreements to whole industries or sectors.,0
"however, sweden's wealth gini coefficient at 0.853 was the second highest in developed countries, and above european and north american averages, suggesting high wealth inequality.",1
"since 1990, taxes as a percentage of gdp collected by sweden have been dropping, with total tax rates for the highest income earners dropping the most.",1
"overall, gdp growth has been fast since reforms—especially those in manufacturing—were enacted in the early 1990s.",1
"according to the economic survey of sweden 2007 by the oecd, the average inflation in sweden has been one of the lowest among european countries since the mid-1990s, largely because of deregulation and quick utilisation of globalisation.the largest trade flows are with germany, the united states, norway, the united kingdom, denmark and finland.",1
"the use of nuclear power has been limited, however.",1
"voters rejected right-hand traffic in 1955, but after the riksdag passed legislation in 1963 changeover took place on 3 september 1967, known in swedish as dagen h.",1

"there are over seventy departures a day each way; during peak times, a ferry departs every fifteen minutes.",0
"the consistent growth of the welfare state led to swedes achieving unprecedented levels of social mobility and quality of life—to this day sweden consistently ranks at the top of league tables for health, literacy and human development—far ahead of some wealthier countries (for example the united states).however, from the 1970s and onwards sweden's gdp growth fell behind other industrialised countries and the country's per capita ranking fell from fourth to 14th place in a few decades.",0
the current swedish government is continuing the trend of moderate rollbacks of previous social reforms.,1
"also since the mid-1980s, sweden has had the fastest growth in inequality of any developed nation, according to the oecd.",1
"nevertheless, it remains far more egalitarian than most nations.",0
"partly as a result of these privatisations and widening economic disparity, the swedes in the 2014 elections put the social democrats back in power.sweden adopted free market agricultural policies in 1990. since the 1930s, the agricultural sector had been subject to price controls.",0
"however, the liberalisations soon became moot because eu agricultural controls supervened.since the late 1960s, sweden has had the highest tax quota (as percentage of gdp) in the industrialised world, although today the gap has narrowed and denmark has surpassed sweden as the most heavily taxed country among developed countries.",1
"electricity, petrol/diesel and alcoholic beverages.",0

"in a 2005 survey by eurobarometer, 89% of swedes reported the ability to speak english.english became a compulsory subject for secondary school students studying natural sciences as early as 1849, and has been a compulsory subject for all swedish students since the late 1940s.",1
most students also study one and sometimes two additional languages.,1
because of the extensive mutual intelligibility between the three continental scandinavian languages swedish speakers often use their native language when visiting or living in norway or denmark.,0
"during the era following the reformation, usually known as the period of lutheran orthodoxy, small groups of non-lutherans, especially calvinist dutchmen, the moravian church and french huguenots played a significant role in trade and industry, and were quietly tolerated as long as they kept a low religious profile.",0
"with religious liberalisations in the late 18th century believers of other faiths, including judaism and roman catholicism, were allowed to live and work freely in the country.",1

"this is, however, not to be confused with the migrants' national backgrounds, which are recorded.",1
"since the early 1970s, immigration to sweden has been mostly due to refugee migration and family reunification from countries in asia (particularly western asia) and latin america.",0
"in 2019, sweden granted 21,958 people asylum, and 21,502 in 2018.in 2021 more than every third person (3,557,912) in sweden had at least one parent born abroad.",0
