"since the reformation of the 16th century, switzerland has maintained a firm policy of armed neutrality; it has not fought an international war since 1815 and did not join the united nations until 2002. nevertheless, it pursues an active foreign policy."
"switzerland is the birthplace of the red cross, one of the world's oldest and best known humanitarian organisations."
"however, it participates in the schengen area and the european single market through bilateral treaties."
"although the majority of the population are german-speaking, swiss national identity is rooted in a common historical background, shared values such as federalism and direct democracy, as well as alpine symbolism.due to its linguistic diversity, switzerland is known by a variety of native names: schweiz [ˈʃvaɪts] (german); suisse [sɥis(ə)] (french); svizzera [ˈzvittsera] (italian); and svizra [ˈʒviːtsrɐ, ˈʒviːtsʁɐ] (romansh)."
"the english adjective swiss is a loan from french suisse, also in use since the 16th century."
"the swiss began to adopt the name for themselves after the swabian war of 1499, used alongside the term for ""confederates"", eidgenossen (literally: comrades by oath), used since the 14th century."
"the name was extended to the area dominated by the canton, and after the swabian war of 1499 gradually came to be used for the entire confederation."
"the long [iː] of swiss german is historically and still often today spelled ⟨y⟩ rather than ⟨ii⟩, preserving the original identity of the two names even in writing."
"switzerland has existed as a state in its present form since the adoption of the swiss federal constitution in 1848. the precursors of switzerland established a defensive alliance at the end of the 13th century (1291), forming a loose confederation of states which persisted for centuries."
"the oldest known farming settlements in switzerland, which were found at gächlingen, have been dated to around 5300 bc."
"the earliest known cultural tribes of the area were members of the hallstatt and la tène cultures, named after the archaeological site of la tène on the north side of lake neuchâtel."

"some regions (uri, schwyz, unterwalden, later known as waldstätten) were accorded the imperial immediacy to grant the empire direct control over the mountain passes."
"with the extinction of its male line in 1263, the kyburg dynasty fell in ad 1264. the habsburgs under king rudolph i (holy roman emperor in 1273) laid claim to the kyburg lands and annexed them extending their territory to the eastern swiss plateau."
"the new regime, known as the helvetic republic, was highly unpopular."
"an invading foreign army had imposed and destroyed centuries of tradition, making switzerland nothing more than a french satellite state."
"switzerland's borders have not changed since, except for some minor adjustments."
"yet however minor the sonderbundskrieg appears compared with other european riots and wars in the 19th century, it nevertheless had a significant impact on both the psychology and the society of the swiss and switzerland."
"in 1891, the constitution was revised with unusually strong elements of direct democracy, which remain unique today."
"in 1920, switzerland joined the league of nations, which was based in geneva, on condition that it was exempt from any military requirements.during world war ii, detailed invasion plans were drawn up by the germans, but switzerland was never attacked."
"the swiss military strategy was changed from one of static defence at the borders to protect the economic heartland to one of organised long-term attrition and withdrawal to strong, well-stockpiled positions high in the alps known as the reduit."
switzerland was an important base for espionage by both sides in the conflict and often mediated communications between the axis and allied powers.switzerland's trade was blockaded by both the allies and by the axis.
"concessions reached a peak after a crucial rail link through vichy france was severed in 1942, leaving switzerland (together with liechtenstein) entirely isolated from the wider world by axis-controlled territory."
the swiss expressed fear and concern that the bombings were intended to put pressure on switzerland to end economic cooperation and neutrality with nazi germany.
"court-martial proceedings took place in england and the u.s. government paid 62,176,433.06 in swiss francs for reparations of the bombings.switzerland's attitude towards refugees was complicated and controversial; over the course of the war, it admitted as many as 300,000 refugees while refusing tens of thousands more, including jews persecuted by the nazis.after the war, the swiss government exported credits through the charitable fund known as the schweizerspende and donated to the marshall plan to help europe's recovery, efforts that ultimately benefited the swiss economy.during the cold war, swiss authorities considered the construction of a swiss nuclear bomb."
"an application for membership in the european union was sent in may 1992, but not advanced since the eea was rejected in december 1992 when switzerland was the only country to launch a referendum on the eea."
"there have since been several referendums on the eu issue; due to opposition from the citizens, the membership application has been withdrawn."
"switzerland, together with liechtenstein, has been surrounded by the eu since austria's entry in 1995. on 5 june 2005, swiss voters agreed by a 55% majority to join the schengen treaty, a result that eu commentators regarded as a sign of support by switzerland."
"however, the voters rejected the attempts of taking back control of immigration, defeating the motion by a roughly 63%–37% margin."
"extending across the north and south side of the alps in west-central europe, switzerland encompasses a great diversity of landscapes and climates on a limited area of 41,285 square kilometres (15,940 sq mi)."
"from these originate the headwaters of several major rivers, such as the rhine, inn, ticino and rhône, which flow in the four cardinal directions into the whole of europe."
"the hydrographic network includes several of the largest bodies of fresh water in central and western europe, among which are included lake geneva (also called le lac léman in french), lake constance (known as bodensee in german) and lake maggiore."
"at 4,634 m (15,203 ft), monte rosa is the highest, although the matterhorn (4,478 m or 14,692 ft) is often regarded as the most famous."
"the section of the bernese alps above the deep glacial lauterbrunnen valley, containing 72 waterfalls, is well known for the jungfrau (4,158 m or 13,642 ft) eiger and mönch, and the many picturesque valleys in the region."
"in the southeast the long engadin valley, encompassing the st. moritz area in canton of graubünden, is also well known; the highest peak in the neighbouring bernina alps is piz bernina (4,049 m or 13,284 ft).the more populous northern part of the country, constituting about 30% of the country's total area, is called the swiss plateau."
"it has greater open and hilly landscapes, partly forested, partly open pastures, usually with grazing herds or vegetables and fruit fields, but it is still hilly."
"the swiss climate is generally temperate, but can vary greatly between the localities, from glacial conditions on the mountaintops to the often pleasant near mediterranean climate at switzerland's southern tip."
"summers tend to be warm and humid at times with periodic rainfall, so they are ideal for pastures and grazing."
"at the same time, the lower lands tend to suffer from inversion, during these periods, thus seeing no sun for weeks."
"a weather phenomenon known as the föhn (with an identical effect to the chinook wind) can occur at all times of the year and is characterised by an unexpectedly warm wind, bringing an air of very low relative humidity to the north of the alps during rainfall periods on the southern face of the alps."
"precipitation tends to be spread moderately throughout the year, with a peak in summer."
"switzerland contains two terrestrial ecoregions: western european broadleaf forests and alps conifer and mixed forests.switzerland's ecosystems can be particularly fragile, because the many delicate valleys separated by high mountains often form unique ecologies."
"nevertheless, according to the 2014 environmental performance index, switzerland ranks first among 132 nations in safeguarding the environment, due to its high scores on environmental public health, its heavy reliance on renewable sources of energy (hydropower and geothermal energy), and its control of greenhouse gas emissions."
"the country pledged to cut ghg emissions by 50% by 2030 compared to the level of 1990 and works on a plan to reach zero emissions by 2050.however, access to biocapacity in switzerland is far lower than world average."
"when both houses are in joint session, they are known collectively as the federal assembly."
"however, the president is a primus inter pares with no additional powers and remains the head of a department within the administration.the swiss government has been a coalition of the four major political parties since 1959, each party having a number of seats that roughly reflects its share of electorate and representation in the federal parliament."
"the classic distribution of 2 cvp/pdc, 2 sps/pss, 2 fdp/prd and 1 svp/udc as it stood from 1959 to 2003 was known as the ""magic formula""."
the 1848 and 1999 swiss constitutions define a system of direct democracy (sometimes called half-direct or representative direct democracy because it is aided by the more commonplace institutions of a representative democracy).
"the instruments of this system at the federal level, known as popular rights (german: volksrechte, french: droits populaires, italian: diritti popolari), include the right to submit a federal initiative and a referendum, both of which may overturn parliamentary decisions.by calling a federal referendum, a group of citizens may challenge a law passed by parliament if they gather 50,000 signatures against the law within 100 days."
"under the federal constitution, all 26 cantons are equal in status, except that 6 (referred to often as the half-cantons) are represented by only one councillor (instead of two) in the council of states and have only half a cantonal vote with respect to the required cantonal majority in referendums on constitutional amendments."
"however, there are considerable differences between the individual cantons, particularly in terms of population and geographical area."
"traditionally, switzerland avoids alliances that might entail military, political, or direct economic action and has been neutral since the end of its expansion in 1515. its policy of neutrality was internationally recognised at the congress of vienna in 1815. only in 2002 did switzerland become a full member of the united nations and it was the first state to join it by referendum."
switzerland is not a member of the european union; the swiss people have consistently rejected membership since the early 1990s.
"however, switzerland does participate in the schengen area."
"geneva is the birthplace of the red cross and red crescent movement, the geneva conventions and, since 2006, hosts the united nations human rights council."

"being a landlocked country, switzerland has no navy; however, on lakes bordering neighbouring countries, armed military patrol boats are used."
"men usually receive military conscription orders for training at the age of 18. about two-thirds of the young swiss are found suited for service; for those found unsuited, various forms of alternative service exist."
"since 2000 the armed force department has also maintained the onyx intelligence gathering system to monitor satellite communications.gun politics in switzerland are unique in europe in that 2–3.5 million guns are in the hands of civilians, giving the nation an estimate of 27.6–41.2 guns per 100 people."
"however, ammunition is no longer issued."
"still, representatives, mayors, and landammänner met several times a year at the capital of the lieu presiding the confederal diet for one year."
"until 1500 the legates met most of the time in lucerne, but also in zürich, baden, bern, schwyz etc., but sometimes also at places outside of the confederation, such as constance."
"afterwards, the town hall at baden, where the annual accounts of the common people had been held regularly since 1426, became the most frequent but not the sole place of assembly."
"the 1999 new constitution, however, does not contain anything concerning any federal city."
"after a first report, the work of this committee was suspended in 2004 by the swiss federal council, and work on this subject has not resumed since.thus as of today, no city in switzerland has the official status either of capital or of federal city."
"nevertheless, bern is commonly referred to as ""federal city"" (german: bundesstadt, french: ville fédérale, italian: città federale)."
"housing and food price levels were 171% and 145% of the eu-25 index in 2007, compared to 113% and 104% in germany.switzerland is home to several large multinational corporations."

"the swiss federal budget had a size of 62.8  billion swiss francs in 2010, which is an equivalent 11.35% of the country's gdp in that year; however, the regional (canton) budgets and the budgets of the municipalities are not counted as part of the federal budget and the total rate of government spending is closer to 33.8% of gdp."
"the unemployment rate increased from a low of 1.7% in june 2000 to a peak of 4.4% in december 2009. the unemployment rate decreased to 3.2% in 2014 and held steady at that level for several years, before further dropping to 2.5% in 2018 and 2.3% in 2019. population growth from net immigration is quite high, at 0.52% of population in 2004, increased in the following years before falling to 0.54% again in 2017. the foreign citizen population was 28.9% in 2015, about the same as in australia."
"this inequality has increased in recent years.about 8.2% of the population live below the national poverty line, defined in switzerland as earning less than chf3,990 per month for a household of two adults and two children, and a further 15% are at risk of poverty."

"in recent years, the swiss have brought their economic practices largely into conformity with those of the eu in many ways, in an effort to enhance their international competitiveness."
"the economy grew at 3% in 2010, 1.9% in 2011, and 1% in 2012. eu membership was a long-term objective of the swiss government, but there was and remains considerable popular sentiment against membership, which is opposed by the conservative svp party, the largest party in the national council, and not currently supported or proposed by several other political parties."
"the western french-speaking areas and the urban regions of the rest of the country tend to be more pro-eu, nonetheless with far from a significant share of the population."
"a second series covering nine areas was signed in 2004 and has since been ratified, which includes the schengen treaty and the dublin convention besides others."
the swiss have also been under eu and sometimes international pressure to reduce banking secrecy and raise tax rates to parity with the eu.
"however, people entering the country had their passports checked until 29 march 2009 if they originated from a schengen nation.on 9 february 2014, swiss voters narrowly approved by 50.3% a ballot initiative launched by the national conservative swiss people's party (svp/udc) to restrict immigration, and thus reintroducing a quota system on the influx of foreigners."
"on 18 may 2003, two anti-nuclear initiatives were turned down: moratorium plus, aimed at forbidding the building of new nuclear power plants (41.6% supported and 58.4% opposed), and electricity without nuclear (33.7% supported and 66.3% opposed) after a previous moratorium expired in 2000. however, as a reaction to the fukushima nuclear disaster, the swiss government announced in 2011 that it plans to end its use of nuclear energy in the next 2 or 3 decades."
"the proportion of the population that has reported being targeted by racial discrimination has increased in recent years, from 10% in 2014 to almost 17% in 2018, according to the federal statistical office.fourteen percent of men and 6.5% of women between 20 and 24 saying they had consumed cannabis in the past 30 days, and 5 swiss cities were listed among the top 10 european cities for cocaine use as measured in wastewater."

"the role played by dialects in each linguistic region varies dramatically: in the german-speaking regions, swiss german dialects have become ever more prevalent since the second half of the 20th century, especially in the media, such as radio and television, and are used as an everyday language for many, while the swiss variety of standard german is almost always used instead of dialect for written communication (c.f."
"conversely, in the french-speaking regions the local dialects have almost disappeared (only 6.3% of the population of valais, 3.9% of fribourg, and 3.1% of jura still spoke dialects at the end of the 20th century), while in the italian-speaking regions dialects are mostly limited to family settings and casual conversation.the principal official languages (german, french, and italian) have terms not used outside of switzerland, known as helvetisms."
"the french spoken in switzerland has similar terms, which are equally known as helvetisms."
"current french dictionaries, such as the petit larousse, include several hundred helvetisms.learning one of the other national languages at school is compulsory for all swiss pupils, so many swiss are supposed to be at least bilingual, especially those belonging to linguistic minority groups."
"swiss residents are universally required to buy health insurance from private insurance companies, which in turn are required to accept every applicant."
"while the cost of the system is among the highest, it compares well with other european countries in terms of health outcomes; patients have been reported as being, in general, highly satisfied with it."
"however, spending on health is particularly high at 11.4% of gdp (2010), on par with germany and france (11.6%) and other european countries, but notably less than spending in the usa (17.6%)."
"since 1935 urban development has claimed as much of the swiss landscape as it did during the previous 2,000 years."

"during the middle ages, sasanian art played a prominent role in the formation of both european and asian medieval art, which carried forward to the islamic world, and much of what later became known as islamic learning—including medicine, architecture, philosophy, philology, and literature—were of sasanian basis.the safavid era is known as the golden age of iranian art, and safavid works of art show a far more unitary development than in any other period, as part of a political evolution that reunified iran as a cultural entity."
"according to persian historian and archaeologist arthur pope, the supreme iranian art, in the proper meaning of the word, has always been its architecture."
"in spite of originating from the region of persis (better known as persia) in southwestern iran, the persian language was used and developed further through persianate societies in asia minor, central asia, and south asia, leaving massive influences on ottoman and mughal literatures, among others."
"the cyrus cylinder, which is known as ""the first charter of human rights"", is often seen as a reflection of the questions and thoughts expressed by zoroaster, and developed in zoroastrian schools of the achaemenid era."
"among them are treatises such as the zatspram, shkand-gumanik vizar, and denkard, as well as older passages of the avesta and the gathas.the current trends in iranian philosophy have grown limited in scope because of islamic frames of thought  although the liberal ways of thought remain open to be generated in iranian publications by iranian intellectuals, especially outside iran, where the iranian regime has less power to restrict iranian thought and philosophy."
"it was significantly developed since the 1950s, using indigenous instruments and forms accompanied by electric guitar and other imported characteristics."
"the oldest iranian initiation of theater and the phenomena of acting can be traced in the ancient epic ceremonial theaters such as sug-e siāvuš (""mourning of siāvaš""), as well as dances and theater narrations of iranian mythological tales reported by herodotus and xenophon."
"iran's traditional theatrical genres include baqqāl-bāzi (""grocer play"", a form of slapstick comedy), ruhowzi (or taxt-howzi, comedy performed over a courtyard pool covered with boards), siāh-bāzi (in which the central comedian appears in blackface), sāye-bāzi (shadow play), xeyme-šab-bāzi (marionette), and arusak-bāzi (puppetry), and ta'zie (religious tragedy plays).before the 1979 revolution, the iranian national stage had become a famous performing scene for known international artists and troupes, with the roudaki hall of tehran constructed to function as the national stage for opera and ballet."
"the earliest attested iranian examples of visual representations, however, are traced back to the bas-reliefs of persepolis, the ritual center of the achaemenid empire."
"the iranian visual arts reached a pinnacle by the sasanian era, and several works from this period have been found to articulate movements and actions in a highly sophisticated manner."
"after him, several others like russi khan, ardeshir khan, and ali vakili tried to establish new movie theaters in tehran."
"critics considered this a remarkable event in the history of iranian cinema.asghar farhadi, a well-known iranian director, has received a golden globe award and two academy awards, representing iran for best foreign language film in 2012 and 2017. in 2012, he was named as one of the 100 most influential people in the world by the american news magazine time."

fashion in iran is divided into several historical periods.
"the exact date of the emergence of weaving in iran is not yet known, but it is likely to coincide with the emergence of civilization."
other discoveries in central iran dating back to 4200 bc have shown that the animals' skin has not been the only clothing worn on the iranian plateau since those years.
"since then, a high number of iranian girls participated in the beauty pageant and miss universe outside of iran."
"in spite of the high latitude, sweden often has warm continental summers, being located in between the north atlantic, the baltic sea, and vast russia."
"germanic peoples have inhabited sweden since prehistoric times, emerging into history as the geats (swedish: götar) and swedes (svear) and constituting the sea peoples known as the norsemen."
"swedish territories outside the scandinavian peninsula were gradually lost during the 18th and 19th centuries, ending with the annexation of present-day finland by russia in 1809. the last war in which sweden was directly involved was in 1814 when norway was militarily forced into a personal union, which peacefully dissolved in 1905. since then, sweden has been at peace, maintaining an official policy of neutrality in foreign affairs."
"sweden was formally neutral through both world wars and the cold war, although sweden has since 2009 openly moved towards cooperation with nato."
"variations of the name sweden are used in most languages, with the exception of danish and norwegian using sverige, faroese svøríki, icelandic svíþjóð, and the more notable exception of some finnic languages where ruotsi (finnish) and rootsi (estonian) are used, names commonly considered as referring to the people from the coastal areas of roslagen, uppland, who were known as the rus', and through them etymologically related to the english name for russia.the etymology of swedes, and thus sweden, is generally agreed to derive from a root *s(w)e, meaning ""one's own"", referring to one's own germanic tribe."
"which kings (*kuningaz) ruled these suiones is unknown, but norse mythology presents a long line of legendary and semi-legendary kings going back to the last centuries bc."
"the suehans were known to the roman world as suppliers of black fox skins and, according to jordanes, had very fine horses, similar to those of the thyringi of germania (alia vero gens ibi moratur suehans, quae velud thyringi equis utuntur eximiis)."
"the byzantine emperor theophilos noticed their great skills in war, and invited them to serve as his personal bodyguard, known as the varangian guard."
"i have never seen more perfect physical specimens, tall as date palms, blond and ruddy; they wear neither tunics nor caftans, but the men wear a garment which covers one side of the body and leaves a hand free."
"what happened to the crew is unknown, but it is believed that they died of sickness."
"it is not known when and how the kingdom of sweden was born, but the list of swedish monarchs is drawn from the first kings known to have ruled both svealand (sweden) and götaland (gothia) as one province, beginning with eric the victorious."
sweden and gothia were two separate nations long before that and since antiquity.
it is not known how long they existed: the epic poem beowulf describes semi-legendary swedish-geatish wars in the sixth century.
"between 800 and 1000, trade brought an abundance of silver to gotland, and according to some scholars, the gotlanders of this era hoarded more silver than the rest of the population of scandinavia combined.st ansgar is usually credited with introducing christianity in 829, but the new religion did not begin to fully replace paganism until the 12th century."
"in the 14th century, the swedish colonisation of coastal areas of finland began to be more organised and in the end of the century several of the coastal areas of finland were inhabited mostly by swedes."
"except for the provinces of scania, blekinge and halland in the south-west of the scandinavian peninsula, which were parts of the kingdom of denmark during this time, feudalism never developed in sweden as it did in the rest of europe."
"slavery (also called thralldom) was not common in sweden, and what slavery there was tended to be driven out of existence thanks to the spread of christianity as well as to the difficulty to obtain slaves from the lands east of the baltic sea, and by the development of cities before the 16th century."
"indeed, both slavery and serfdom were abolished altogether by a decree of king magnus iv in 1335. former slaves tended to be absorbed into the peasantry, and some became labourers in the towns."
"however, margaret's successors, whose rule was also centred in denmark, were unable to control the swedish nobility."
"king christian ii of denmark, who asserted his claim to sweden by force of arms, ordered a massacre of swedish nobles in stockholm in 1520. this came to be known as the ""stockholm blood bath"" and stirred the swedish nobility to new resistance and, on 6 june (now sweden's national holiday) in 1523, they made gustav vasa their king."
this is sometimes considered as the foundation of modern sweden.
"the main exports from sweden were iron and copper.however, the swedes began to resent the monopoly trading position of the hansa (mostly consisting of german citizens), and to resent the income they felt they lost to the hansa."
"he pursued to strengthen rome's influence by initiating counter-reformation and created a dual monarchy, which temporarily became known as the polish-swedish union."
"following his deposition in 1599, sigismund attempted to reclaim the throne at every expense and hostilities between poland and sweden continued for the next one hundred years."
"famine also hit sweden, killing roughly 10% of sweden's population.the swedes conducted a series of invasions into the polish–lithuanian commonwealth, known as the deluge."
"russia, the most serious threat to sweden at this time, had a larger army but lagged far behind in both equipment and training.after the battle of narva in 1700, one of the first battles of the great northern war, the russian army was so severely devastated that sweden had an open chance to invade russia."
"however, charles xii did not pursue the russian army, instead turning against poland–lithuania and defeating the polish king, augustus ii the strong, and his saxon allies at the battle of kliszów in 1702. this gave russia time to rebuild and modernise its army."
"however, in 1810, a french marshal, jean-baptiste bernadotte, was chosen as heir presumptive to the decrepit charles xiii; in 1818, he established the house of bernadotte, taking the regnal name of charles xiv."
"nevertheless, sweden remained poor, retaining a nearly entirely agricultural economy even as denmark and western european countries began to industrialise."
"because the swedish peasantry had never been enserfed as elsewhere in europe, the swedish farming culture began to take on a critical role in swedish politics, which has continued through modern times with modern agrarian party (now called the centre party)."
"however, sweden supported norwegian resistance against germany, and in 1943 helped rescue danish jews from deportation to nazi concentration camps."
"during the last year of the war, sweden began to play a role in humanitarian efforts, and many refugees, among them several thousand jews from nazi-occupied europe, were rescued thanks to the swedish rescue missions to internment camps and partly because sweden served as a haven for refugees, primarily from the nordic countries and the baltic states."
"nevertheless, both swedes and others have argued that sweden could have done more to oppose the nazis' war efforts, even if it meant increasing the risk of occupation."
"during the 1960s the efta countries were often referred to as the outer seven, as opposed to the inner six of the then-european economic community (eec).sweden, like many industrialised countries, entered a period of economic decline and upheaval following the oil embargoes of 1973–74 and 1978–79."
in the 1980s several key swedish industries were significantly restructured.
"the provinces are usually grouped together in three large lands, parts, the northern norrland, the central svealand and southern götaland."
"northern and central sweden have several wide rivers known as älvar, commonly sourced within the scandinavian mountains."
"in southern sweden, narrower rivers known as åar are also common."
"the winter in the far south is usually weak and is manifested only through some shorter periods with snow and sub-zero temperatures, autumn may well turn into spring there, without a distinct period of winter."
the warmest summers usually happen in the mälaren valley around stockholm due to the vast landmass shielding the middle east coast from atlantic low-pressure systems in july compared to the south and west.
"north of the arctic circle, the sun never sets for part of each summer, and it never rises for part of each winter."
"the highest temperature ever recorded in sweden was 38 °c (100 °f) in målilla in 1947, while the coldest temperature ever recorded was −52.6 °c (−62.7 °f) in vuoggatjålme on 2 february 1966. temperatures expected in sweden are heavily influenced by the large fennoscandian landmass, as well as continental europe and western russia, which allows hot or cool inland air to be easily transported to sweden."
"that, in turn, renders most of sweden's southern areas having warmer summers than almost everywhere in the nearby british isles, even matching temperatures found along the continental atlantic coast as far south as in northern spain."
"in winter, however, the same high-pressure systems sometimes put the entire country far below freezing temperatures."
there is some maritime moderation from the atlantic which renders the swedish continental climate less severe than that of nearby russia.
"apart from the ice-free atlantic bringing marine air into sweden tempering winters, the mildness is further explained by prevailing low-pressure systems postponing winter, with the long nights often staying above freezing in the south of the country due to the abundant cloud cover."
an example is that the coldest ever month (january 1987) in stockholm was also the sunniest january month on record.the relative strength of low and high-pressure systems of marine and continental air also define the highly variable summers.
"the bare mountain zonesouthern deciduous forest zone, also known as the nemoral region, the southern deciduous forest zone is a part of a larger vegetation zone which also includes denmark and large parts of central europe."
they tend to grow too quickly due to being outside of their native range and large distances between the tree rings cause poor board quality.
"during the last 40–50 years large areas of former spruce plantings have been replanted with deciduous forest.southern coniferous forest zone, also known as the boreo-nemoral region, the southern coniferous forest zone is delimited by the oak's northern natural limit (limes norrlandicus) and the spruce's southern natural limit, between the southern deciduous zone and the taiga farther north."
birch grows largely everywhere.
this is however not the case with oak and ash.
"pine and spruce are dominant, but the forests are slowly but surely more sparsely grown the farther towards the north it gets."
"sweden has four fundamental laws (swedish: grundlagar) which together form the constitution: the instrument of government (swedish: regeringsformen), the act of succession (swedish: successionsordningen), the freedom of the press act (swedish: tryckfrihetsförordningen), and the fundamental law on freedom of expression (swedish: yttrandefrihetsgrundlagen).the public sector in sweden is divided into two parts: the legal person known as the state (swedish: staten) and local authorities: the latter include regional county councils (swedish: landsting) and local municipalities (swedish: kommuner)."
"notwithstanding their self-rule, local authorities are nevertheless in practice interdependent upon the state, as the parameters of their responsibilities and the extent of their jurisdiction are specified in the local government act (swedish: kommunallagen) passed by the riksdag.sweden is a constitutional monarchy, and king carl xvi gustaf is the head of state, but the role of the monarch is limited to ceremonial and representative functions."
"general elections are held every four years, on the second sunday of september."
"the swedish social democratic party has played a leading role in swedish politics since 1917, after the reformists had confirmed their strength and the left-wing revolutionaries formed their own party."
"only five general elections since world war ii—1976, 1979, 1991, 2006 and 2010—have given the assembled bloc of centre-right parties enough seats in the riksdag to form a government."
"in the 2010 general election the alliance contended against a unified left block consisting of the social democrats, the greens and the left party."
"nevertheless, neither the alliance, nor the left block, chose to form a coalition with the sweden democrats.the outcome of the 2014 general election resulted in the attainment of more seats by the three centre-left parties in comparison to the centre-right alliance for sweden, with the two blocs receiving 159 and 141 seats respectively."
"on 3 october 2014, stefan löfven formed a minority government consisting of the social democrats and the greens.election turnout in sweden has always been high by international comparison."
"although it declined in recent decades, the latest elections saw an increase in voter turnout (80.11% in 2002, 81.99% in 2006, 84.63% in 2010, 85.81 in 2014) and 87.18% in 2018. swedish politicians enjoyed a high degree of confidence from the citizens in the 1960s, however, that level of confidence has since declined steadily, and is now at a markedly lower level than in its scandinavian neighbours."
every region corresponds to a county (län) with a number of municipalities per county.
both levels have legislative assemblies (municipal councils and region assemblies of between 31 and 101 members (always an uneven number) that are elected from party-list proportional representation at the general election which are held every four years in conjunction with the national parliamentary elections.
the actual age of the kingdom of sweden is unknown.
"however, historians usually start the line of swedish monarchs from when svealand and götaland were ruled under the same king, namely eric the victorious (geat) and his son olof skötkonung in the tenth century."
"these events are often described as the consolidation of sweden, although substantial areas were conquered and incorporated later."
"as a reaction to the failed great northern war, a parliamentary system was introduced in 1719, followed by three different flavours of constitutional monarchy in 1772, 1789 and 1809, the latter granting several civil liberties."
"already during the first of those three periods, the 'era of liberty' (1719–72) the swedish rikstag had developed into a very active parliament, and this tradition continued into the nineteenth century, laying the basis for the transition towards modern democracy at the end of that century.in 1866 sweden became a constitutional monarchy with a bicameral parliament, with the first chamber indirectly elected by local governments, and the second chamber directly elected in national elections every four years."
"the global gender gap report 2006 ranked sweden as the number one country in terms of gender equality.some swedish political figures have become known worldwide, among these are: raoul wallenberg, folke bernadotte, the former secretary-general of the united nations dag hammarskjöld, the former prime minister olof palme, the former prime minister and later foreign minister carl bildt, the former president of the general assembly of the united nations jan eliasson, and the former international atomic energy agency iraq inspector hans blix."
"each of these systems has three tiers, where the top tier court of the respective system typically only will hear cases that may become precedent."
"the decrease in the number of swedish prisoners was considered ""out-of-the-ordinary"" by the head of sweden's prison and probation services, with prison numbers in sweden falling by around 1% a year since 2004. prisons were closed in the towns of åby, håja, båtshagen, and kristianstad."
sweden's government pursued an independent course of nonalignment in times of peace so that neutrality would be possible in the event of war.sweden's doctrine of neutrality is often traced back to the 19th century as the country has not been in a state of war since the end of the swedish campaign against norway in 1814. during world war ii sweden joined neither the allied nor axis powers.
"this has sometimes been disputed since in effect sweden allowed in select cases the nazi regime to use its railroad system to transport troops and goods, especially iron ore from mines in northern sweden, which was vital to the german war machine."
"however, sweden also indirectly contributed to the defence of finland in the winter war, and permitted the training of norwegian and danish troops in sweden after 1943."
later investigations revealed that the plane was actually gathering information for nato.
research has never clearly established whether the submarine ended up on the shoals through a navigational mistake or if an enemy committed espionage against swedish military potential.
"nevertheless, the country remains active in peace keeping missions and maintains a considerable foreign aid budget."
"since 1995 sweden has been a member of the european union, and as a consequence of a new world security situation the country's foreign policy doctrine has been partly modified, with sweden playing a more active role in european security co-operation."
the law is enforced in sweden by several government entities.
"in recent years, the number of conscripted males has shrunk dramatically, while the number of female volunteers has increased slightly."
"however, on 11 december 2014, due to tensions in the baltic area, the swedish government reintroduced one part of the swedish conscription system, refresher training."
the high coverage of collective agreements is achieved despite the absence of state mechanisms extending collective agreements to whole industries or sectors.
"however, sweden's wealth gini coefficient at 0.853 was the second highest in developed countries, and above european and north american averages, suggesting high wealth inequality."
"since 1990, taxes as a percentage of gdp collected by sweden have been dropping, with total tax rates for the highest income earners dropping the most."
"overall, gdp growth has been fast since reforms—especially those in manufacturing—were enacted in the early 1990s."
"according to the economic survey of sweden 2007 by the oecd, the average inflation in sweden has been one of the lowest among european countries since the mid-1990s, largely because of deregulation and quick utilisation of globalisation.the largest trade flows are with germany, the united states, norway, the united kingdom, denmark and finland."
"the use of nuclear power has been limited, however."
"voters rejected right-hand traffic in 1955, but after the riksdag passed legislation in 1963 changeover took place on 3 september 1967, known in swedish as dagen h."
sweden also has a number of car ferry connections to several neighbouring countries.
there are several connections from the stockholm area across the sea of åland to mariehamn in åland as well as turku and helsinki on the finnish mainland and beyond to estonia and st petersburg in russia.
"despite the opening of the fixed link to denmark, the øresund bridge, the busiest ferry route remains the short link across the narrowest section of the øresund between helsingborg and the danish port of helsingør, known as the hh ferry route."
"there are over seventy departures a day each way; during peak times, a ferry departs every fifteen minutes."
"the consistent growth of the welfare state led to swedes achieving unprecedented levels of social mobility and quality of life—to this day sweden consistently ranks at the top of league tables for health, literacy and human development—far ahead of some wealthier countries (for example the united states).however, from the 1970s and onwards sweden's gdp growth fell behind other industrialised countries and the country's per capita ranking fell from fourth to 14th place in a few decades."
the current swedish government is continuing the trend of moderate rollbacks of previous social reforms.
"also since the mid-1980s, sweden has had the fastest growth in inequality of any developed nation, according to the oecd."
"nevertheless, it remains far more egalitarian than most nations."
"partly as a result of these privatisations and widening economic disparity, the swedes in the 2014 elections put the social democrats back in power.sweden adopted free market agricultural policies in 1990. since the 1930s, the agricultural sector had been subject to price controls."
"however, the liberalisations soon became moot because eu agricultural controls supervened.since the late 1960s, sweden has had the highest tax quota (as percentage of gdp) in the industrialised world, although today the gap has narrowed and denmark has surpassed sweden as the most heavily taxed country among developed countries."
"electricity, petrol/diesel and alcoholic beverages."
for several decades the swedish government has prioritised scientific and r&d activities.
"since 1990, taxes as a percentage of gdp collected by sweden have been dropping, with total tax rates for the highest income earners dropping the most."
every swedish resident receives a state pension.
"there are several types of pensions in sweden: national retirement, occupational and private pensions."
"an area known as finnveden, which is located in the south-west of småland, and mainly below the 57th parallel, can also be considered as almost empty of people."
"however, no official statistics are kept on language use.along with finnish, four other minority languages are also recognised: meänkieli, sami, romani, and yiddish."
"in a 2005 survey by eurobarometer, 89% of swedes reported the ability to speak english.english became a compulsory subject for secondary school students studying natural sciences as early as 1849, and has been a compulsory subject for all swedish students since the late 1940s."
most students also study one and sometimes two additional languages.
because of the extensive mutual intelligibility between the three continental scandinavian languages swedish speakers often use their native language when visiting or living in norway or denmark.
"during the era following the reformation, usually known as the period of lutheran orthodoxy, small groups of non-lutherans, especially calvinist dutchmen, the moravian church and french huguenots played a significant role in trade and industry, and were quietly tolerated as long as they kept a low religious profile."
"with religious liberalisations in the late 18th century believers of other faiths, including judaism and roman catholicism, were allowed to live and work freely in the country."
"however, until 1860 it remained illegal for lutherans to convert to another religion."
approximately 2% of the church's members regularly attend sunday services.
"since 1996, only children and adults who are christened become members."
"some 275,000 swedes are today members of various evangelical protestant free churches (where congregation attendance is much higher), and due to recent immigration, there are now some 100,000 eastern orthodox christians and 92,000 roman catholics living in sweden.the first muslim congregation was established in 1949, when a small contingent of tatars migrated from finland."
"further immigration from north africa and the middle east have brought the estimated muslim population to 600,000. however, only about 110,000 were members of a congregation around 2010.according to the eurobarometer poll 2010,"
"between the ages of 6 and 16, children attend compulsory comprehensive school."
"along with several other european countries, the government also subsidises tuition of international students pursuing a degree at swedish institutions, although a recent bill passed in the riksdag will limit this subsidy to students from eea countries and switzerland.the large influx of immigrants to swedish schools has been cited as a significant part of the reason why sweden has dropped more than any other european country in the international pisa rankings."
"this is, however, not to be confused with the migrants' national backgrounds, which are recorded."
"since the early 1970s, immigration to sweden has been mostly due to refugee migration and family reunification from countries in asia (particularly western asia) and latin america."
"in 2019, sweden granted 21,958 people asylum, and 21,502 in 2018.in 2021 more than every third person (3,557,912) in sweden had at least one parent born abroad."
"the total immigration to sweden for 2017 will be roughly 180,000 people, and after that 110,000 individuals every year."
"the nation's most well-known artists are painters such as carl larsson and anders zorn, and the sculptors tobias sergel and carl milles."
"since 1 may 2009, sweden repealed its ""registered partnership"" laws and fully replaced them with gender-neutral marriage, sweden also offers domestic partnerships for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples."

"the licence-funded television service was officially launched in 1956. a second channel, tv2, was launched in 1969. these two channels (operated by sveriges television since the late 1970s) held a monopoly until the 1980s when cable and satellite television became available."
the first swedish-language satellite service was tv3 which started broadcasting from london in 1987. it was followed by kanal 5 in 1989 (then known as nordic channel) and tv4 in 1990.

"pre-islamic arabia, the territory that constitutes modern-day saudi arabia, was the site of several ancient cultures and civilizations; the prehistory of saudi arabia shows some of the earliest traces of human activity in the world."
the kingdom of saudi arabia was founded in 1932 by king abdulaziz (known as ibn saud in the west).
"saudi arabia has since been an absolute monarchy, where the king, the princes of the large al saud royal family and the country’s traditional elites have overseen a highly authoritarian regime."
"saudi arabia is sometimes called ""the land of the two holy mosques"" in reference to al-masjid al-haram (in mecca) and al-masjid an-nabawi (in medina), the two holiest places in islam."
petroleum was discovered on 3 march 1938 and followed up by several other finds in the eastern province.
"saudi arabia has since become the world's second-largest oil producer (behind the us) and the world's largest oil exporter, controlling the world's second-largest oil reserves and the sixth largest gas reserves."
"the state has attracted criticism for a variety of reasons, including its role in the yemeni civil war, alleged sponsorship of islamic terrorism and its poor human rights record, which has been characterized by the excessive and often extrajudicial use of capital punishment, failure to adopt adequate measures against human trafficking, state-sponsored discrimination against religious minorities and atheists, and antisemitism, and its strict interpretation of sharia law.saudi arabia is considered both a regional and middle power."
"although this is normally translated as ""the kingdom of saudi arabia"" in english, it literally means ""the saudi arab kingdom"", or ""the arab saudi kingdom"".the word ""saudi"" is derived from the element as-saʿūdīyah in the arabic name of the country, which is a type of adjective known as a nisba, formed from the dynastic name of the saudi royal family, the al saud (arabic: آل سعود)."
"al-magar statues were made from local stone, and it seems that the statues were fixed in a central building that might have had a significant role on the social and religious life of the inhabitants.in november 2017, hunting scenes showing images of most likely domesticated dogs, resembling the canaan dog, wearing leashes were discovered in shuwaymis, a hilly region of northwestern saudi arabia."
"however, experts such as joan oates had the opportunity to see the ubaid period sherds in eastern arabia and consequently conclude that the sherds date to the last two phases of the ubaid period (period three and four), while a handful of examples could be classified roughly as either ubaid 3 or ubaid 2. thus the idea that colonists from saudi arabia had emigrated to southern mesopotamia and founded the region's first sedentary culture was abandoned.climatic change and the onset of aridity may have brought about the end of this phase of settlement, as little archaeological evidence exists from the succeeding millennium."
"known records from uruk refer to a place called dilmun, associated on several occasions with copper, and in later period it was a source of imported woods in southern mesopotamia."
"the statue was locally made under the strong mesopotamian influence on the artistic principle of dilmun.by 2200 bc, the centre of dilmun shifted for unknown reasons from tarout and the saudi arabian mainland to the island of bahrain, and a highly developed settlement emerged there, where a laborious temple complex and thousands of burial mounds dating to this period were discovered."

"from the 10th century to the early 20th century, mecca and medina were under the control of a local arab ruler known as the sharif of mecca, but at most times the sharif owed allegiance to the ruler of one of the major islamic empires based in baghdad, cairo or istanbul."
most of the remainder of what became saudi arabia reverted to traditional tribal rule.
their rule extended from iraq to oman at its height and they too came under ottoman suzerainty.
"the emergence of what was to become the saudi royal family, known as the al saud, began in nejd in central arabia in february 1727, when muhammad bin saud, founder of the dynasty, joined forces with the religious leader muhammad ibn abd al-wahhab, founder of the wahhabi movement, a strict puritanical form of sunni islam."
"in 1902, abdul rahman's son, abdul aziz—later to be known as ibn saud—recaptured control of riyadh bringing the al saud back to nejd, creating the third ""saudi state""."
"oil provided saudi arabia with economic prosperity and substantial political leverage internationally.cultural life rapidly developed, primarily in the hejaz, which was the centre for newspapers and radio."
"however, the large influx of foreign workers in saudi arabia in the oil industry increased the pre-existing propensity for xenophobia."
there were several anti-government uprisings in the region such as the 1979 qatif uprising.the second event was the grand mosque seizure in mecca by islamist extremists.
"although there was a dramatic change in the social and economic life of the country, political power continued to be monopolized by the royal family leading to discontent among many saudis who began to look for wider participation in government.in the 1980s, saudi arabia spent $25 billion in support of saddam hussein in the iran–iraq war; however, saudi arabia condemned the iraqi invasion of kuwait in 1990 and asked the us to intervene."
many saudis who did not support the islamist terrorists were nevertheless deeply unhappy with the government's policies.islamism was not the only source of hostility to the government.
"""in 1995, fahd suffered a debilitating stroke, and the crown prince, abdullah, assumed the role of de facto regent, taking on the day-to-day running of the country; however, his authority was hindered by conflict with fahd's full brothers (known, with fahd, as the ""sudairi seven"")."
"in february–april 2005, the first-ever nationwide municipal elections were held in saudi arabia."
"police stopped the demonstration after about 15 minutes and arrested 30 to 50 people.since 2011, saudi arabia has been affected by its own arab spring protests."
"although male-only municipal elections were held on 29 september 2011, abdullah allowed women to vote and be elected in the 2015 municipal elections, and also to be nominated to the shura council.since 2001, saudi arabia has engaged in widespread internet censorship."
"saudi arabia is an absolute monarchy; however, according to the basic law of saudi arabia adopted by royal decree in 1992, the king must comply with sharia (islamic law) and the quran, while the quran and the sunnah (the traditions of muhammad) are declared to be the country's constitution."
"this process is not reported by the saudi media.by custom, all males of full age have a right to petition the king directly through the traditional tribal meeting known as the majlis."
"as mentioned earlier, in recent years there have been limited steps to widen political participation such as the establishment of the consultative council in the early 1990s and the national dialogue forum in 2003.the rule of the al saud faces political opposition from four sources: sunni islamist activism; liberal critics; the shi'ite minority—particularly in the eastern province; and long-standing tribal and regionalist particularistic opponents (for example in the hejaz)."
"of these, the minority activists have been the most prominent threat to the government and have in recent years perpetrated a number of violent incidents in the country."
"however, open protest against the government, even if peaceful, is not tolerated."
"the key ministries are generally reserved for the royal family, as are the 13 regional governorships.long-term political and government appointments have resulted in the creation of ""power fiefdoms"" for senior princes, such as those of king abdullah, who had been commander of the national guard since 1963 (until 2010, when he appointed his son to replace him), former crown prince sultan, minister of defence and aviation from 1962 to his death in 2011, former crown prince prince nayef who was the minister of interior from 1975 to his death in 2012, prince saud who had been minister of foreign affairs since 1975 and current king salman, who was minister of defense and aviation before he was crown prince and governor of the riyadh province from 1962 to 2011. the current minister of defense is prince mohammad bin salman, the son of king salman and crown prince.the royal family is politically divided by factions based on clan loyalties, personal ambitions and ideological differences."
"the most powerful clan faction is known as the 'sudairi seven', comprising the late king fahd and his full brothers and their descendants."
"the saudi government and the royal family have often been accused of corruption over many years, and this continues into the 21st century."
"the extent of corruption has been described as systemic and endemic, and its existence was acknowledged and defended by prince bandar bin sultan (a senior member of the royal family) in an interview in 2001. although corruption allegations have often been limited to broad undocumented accusations, specific allegations were made in 2007, when it was claimed that the british defence contractor bae systems had paid prince bandar us$2 billion in bribes relating to the al-yamamah arms deal."
"in 2009, the king made significant personnel changes to the government by appointing reformers to key positions and the first woman to a ministerial post; however, these changes have been criticized as being too slow or merely cosmetic."
"however, this changed following the seizure of the grand mosque in mecca in 1979 by islamist radicals."
"saudi judges tend to follow the principles of the hanbali school of jurisprudence (fiqh) found in pre-modern texts and noted for its literalist interpretation of the qur'an and hadith.because the judge is empowered to disregard previous judgments (either his own or of other judges) and may apply his personal interpretation of sharia to any particular case, divergent judgments arise even in apparently identical cases, making predictability of legal interpretation difficult."
extra-sharia government tribunals usually handle disputes relating to specific royal decrees.
"final appeal from both sharia courts and government tribunals is to the king and all courts and tribunals follow sharia rules of evidence and procedure.the saudi system of justice has been criticized for its ""ultra-puritanical judges"", who are often harsh in their sentencing (with beheading for the crime of witchcraft), but also sometimes overly lenient (for cases of rape or wife-beating) and slow, for example leaving thousands of abandoned women unable to secure a divorce."
"although repeated theft can be punishable by amputation of the right hand, only one instance of judicial amputation was reported between 2007 and 2010.  atheism or ""calling into question the fundamentals of the islamic religion on which this country is based"" is considered a terrorist crime."
"lashings are a common form of punishment and are often imposed for offences against religion and public morality such as drinking alcohol and neglect of prayer and fasting obligations.retaliatory punishments, or qisas, are practised: for instance, an eye can be surgically removed at the insistence of a victim who lost his own eye."
"saudi arabia supports the intended formation of the arab customs union in 2015 and an arab common market by 2020, as announced at the 2009 arab league summit.since 1960, as a founding member of opec, its oil pricing policy has been generally to stabilize the world oil market and try to moderate sharp price movements so as to not jeopardize the western economies."
"however, there is evidence that the vast majority was, in fact, spent on propagating and extending the influence of wahhabism at the expense of other forms of islam."
"saudi arabia and the united states are strategic allies, and since president barack obama took office in 2009, the us has sold $110 billion in arms to saudi arabia."
"however, the relationship between saudi arabia and the united states became strained and have witnessed major decline during the last years of the obama administration, although obama had authorized us forces to provide logistical and intelligence support to the saudis in their military intervention in yemen, establishing a joint coordination planning cell with the saudi military that is helping manage the war, and cia used saudi bases for drone assassinations in yemen."
"in the arab and muslim worlds, saudi arabia is considered to be pro-western and pro-american, and it is certainly a long-term ally of the united states."
"however, this and saudi arabia's role in the 1991 persian gulf war, particularly the stationing of us troops on saudi soil from 1991, prompted the development of a hostile islamist response internally."
"at least 56,000 people have been killed in armed violence in yemen between january 2016 and october 2018.saudi arabia, together with qatar and turkey, openly supported the army of conquest, an umbrella group of anti-government forces fighting in the syrian civil war that reportedly included an al-qaeda linked al-nusra front and another salafi coalition known as ahrar al-sham."
"saudi-us relations took an ugly turn on 14 october 2018, when trump promised ""severe punishment"" if the royal court was responsible for khashoggis' death."
"indeed, osama bin laden and 15 out of the 19 9/11 hijackers were from saudi arabia; in isil-occupied raqqa, in mid-2014, all 12 judges were saudi."

"rabbits, also known as bunnies or bunny rabbits, are small mammals in the family leporidae (which also contains the hares) of the order lagomorpha (which also contains the pikas)."
"the european rabbit, which has been introduced on every continent except antarctica, is familiar throughout the world as a wild prey animal and as a domesticated form of livestock and pet."
"another term for a young rabbit is bunny, though this term is often applied informally (particularly by children) to rabbits generally, especially domestic ones."
"a group of rabbits is known as a colony or nest (or, occasionally, a warren, though this more commonly refers to where the rabbits live)."
"a group of baby rabbits produced from a single mating is referred to as a litter and a group of domestic rabbits living together is sometimes called a herd.the word rabbit itself derives from the middle english rabet, a borrowing from the walloon robète, which was a diminutive of the french or middle dutch robbe."
"the term ""rabbit"" is typically used for all leporidae species excluding the genus lepus."
members of that genus are instead known as hares or jackrabbits.
"lepus species are typically precocial, born relatively mature and mobile with hair and good vision, while other rabbit species are altricial, born hairless and blind, and requiring closer care."
"selective breeding has generated a wide variety of rabbit breeds, of which many (since the early 19th century) are also kept as pets."
"rabbit fur, prized for its softness, can be found in a broad range of coat colors and patterns, as well as lengths."
"the angora rabbit breed, for example, was developed for its long, silky fur, which is often hand-spun into yarn."
"this way they can be distinguished from rodents, with which they are often confused."
"recent dna analysis and the discovery of a common ancestor has supported the view that they share a common lineage, so rabbits and rodents are now often grouped together in the superorder glires."
"since speed and agility are a rabbit's main defenses against predators (including the swift fox), rabbits have large hind leg bones and well developed musculature."
"in the family leporidae, the ears are typically longer than they are wide."
"the auricle, also known as the pinna, is a rabbit's outer ear."
"another theory is that the ears function as shock absorbers that could aid and stabilize rabbit's vision when fleeing predators, but this has typically only been seen in hares."
"from there, the air moves into the nasal cavity, also known as the nasopharynx, down through the trachea, through the larynx, and into the lungs."
"the branching that is typically found in rabbit lungs is a clear example of monopodial branching, in which smaller branches divide out laterally from a larger central branch.the structure of the rabbit's nasal and oral cavities, necessitates breathing through the nose."
"they pass two distinct types of feces: hard droppings and soft black viscous pellets, the latter of which are known as caecotrophs or ""night droppings""  and are immediately eaten (a behaviour known as coprophagy)."
"rabbits reingest their own droppings (rather than chewing the cud as do cows and numerous other herbivores) to digest their food further and extract sufficient nutrients.rabbits graze heavily and rapidly for roughly the first half-hour of a grazing period (usually in the late afternoon), followed by about half an hour of more selective feeding."
"while out of the burrow, the rabbit will occasionally reingest its soft, partially digested pellets; this is rarely observed, since the pellets are reingested as they are produced."
"soft pellets are usually produced several hours after grazing, after the hard pellets have all been excreted."
"cecotropes, sometimes called ""night feces"", are high in minerals, vitamins and proteins that are necessary to the rabbit's health."
"because rabbits cannot vomit, if buildup occurs within the intestines (due often to a diet with insufficient fibre), intestinal blockage can occur."
"as with other prey animals, rabbits often sleep with their eyes open, so that sudden movements will awaken the rabbit to respond to potential danger."
"rabbits and hares are almost never found to be infected with rabies and have not been known to transmit rabies to humans.encephalitozoon cuniculi, an obligate intracellular parasite is also capable of infecting many mammals including rabbits."
rabbits are prey animals and are therefore constantly aware of their surroundings.
"rabbits live in groups, and the best known species, the european rabbit, lives in burrows, or rabbit holes."
"at farmers markets there, including the famous borough market in london, rabbit carcasses are sometimes displayed hanging, unbutchered (in the traditional style), next to braces of pheasant or other small game."
"an extremely rare infection associated with rabbits-as-food is tularemia (also known as rabbit fever), which may be contracted from an infected rabbit."
production industries have developed domesticated rabbit breeds (such as the well-known angora rabbit) to efficiently fill these needs.
"rabbits are often used as a symbol of fertility or rebirth, and have long been associated with spring and easter as the easter bunny."
"the species' role as a prey animal with few defenses evokes vulnerability and innocence, and in folklore and modern children's stories, rabbits often appear as sympathetic characters, able to connect easily with youth of all kinds (for example, the velveteen rabbit, or thumper in bambi)."
"the rabbit (as a swift prey animal) is also known for its speed, agility, and endurance, symbolized (for example) by the marketing icons the energizer bunny and the duracell bunny."
"the rabbit often appears in folklore as the trickster archetype, as he uses his cunning to outwit his enemies."
"in aztec mythology, a pantheon of four hundred rabbit gods known as centzon totochtin, led by ometochtli or two rabbit, represented fertility, parties, and drunkenness."
"in central africa, the common hare (kalulu), is ""inevitably described"" as a trickster figure."
the local rabbits' tendency to burrow there would weaken the walls and their collapse resulted in injuries or even death.
"shrines often contain idols, relics, or other such objects associated with the figure being venerated."
"shrines can be found in various settings, such as churches, temples, cemeteries, museums, or in the home."
"however, portable shrines are also found in some cultures."
a shrine here is usually the center of attention in the building and is given a place of prominence.
"this shrine is usually a small structure or a setup of pictures and figurines dedicated to a deity that is part of the official religion, to ancestors or to a localised household deity."
"many consist of a statue of christ, virgin mary or a saint, on a pedestal or in an alcove, while others may be elaborate booths without ceilings, some include paintings, statuary, and architectural elements, such as walls, roofs, glass doors and ironwork fences.in the united states, some christians have small yard shrines; some of these resemble side altars, since they are composed of a statue placed in a niche or grotto; this type is colloquially referred to as a bathtub madonna."
"religious images, usually in some sort of small shelter, placed by a road or pathway, sometimes in a settlement or at a crossroads."
"as distinguished from a temple, a shrine usually houses a particular relic or cult image, which is the object of worship or veneration."
"they were also called devotional altars, since they could look like small side altars or bye-altars."
"shrines were always centered on some image of christ, mary or a saint – for instance, a statue, painting, mural or mosaic, and may have had a reredos behind them (without a tabernacle built in).however, mass would not be celebrated at them; they were simply used to aid or give a visual focus for prayers."
"side altars, where mass could actually be celebrated, were used in a similar way to shrines by parishioners."
"the son of ahmad ibn hanbal, one of the primary jurists of sunnism, reportedly stated that he would prefer to be buried near the mausoleum of a saintly person than his own father."
"many modern islamic reformers oppose the building (and sometimes the visitation of) tomb shrines, viewing it as a deviation from true islam."
"the shafi'i hadith master ibn hajar al-asqalani stated that ""this is one of the ugliest positions that has been reported of ibn taymiyya""."
"shias have several mazars dedicated to various religious figures important in their history, and several elaborate shrines (marqad/maqam) are dedicated to shia religious figures, most notably in iraq (such as in the cities of karbala, najaf, samarra) and in iran (such as in the cities of qom and mashad)."
the area around timbuktu in mali also has many historic sufi shrines which were destroyed by islamist in recent years.
many of these have since been rebuilt.
"in order to show reverence to sufi saints, kings, and nobles provided large donations or waqf to preserve the tombs and renovate them architecturally."
"the two most well-known baháʼí faith shrines serve as the resting places for the respective remains of the two central figures of the baháʼí faith, the báb and bahá'u'lláh."
"monks, nuns and laypeople all give offerings to these revered figures at these shrines and also meditate in front of them."
"typically, buddhist shrines contain a statue of either the buddha, or (in the mahayana and vajrayana forms of buddhism), one of the various bodhisattvas."
"site-specific shrines in buddhism, particularly those that contain relics of deceased buddhas and revered monks, are often designed in the traditional form known as the stupa."
"ancient filipinos and filipinos who continue to adhere to the indigenous philippine folk religions generally do not have so-called ""temples"" of worship under the context known to foreign cultures."
"however, they do have sacred shrines, which are also called as spirit houses."
"these shrines were known in various indigenous terms, which depend on the ethnic group association."
taotao may sometimes also be placed on these platforms.other types of sacred places or objects of worship of diwata include the material manifestation of their realms.
"the term appears in skaldic poetry and in place names in scandinavia (with the exception of iceland), often in connection with a norse deity or a geographic feature."
shrines are typically located inside a hindu temple of various forms.
the line between a temple and a shrine in taoism is not fully defined;  shrines are usually smaller versions of larger taoist temples or small places in a home where a yin-yang emblem is placed among peaceful settings to encourage meditation and study of taoist texts and principles.
"taoists place less emphasis on formalized attendance but include ritualized worship than other asian religions;  formal temples and structures of worship came about in taoism mostly in order to prevent losing adherents to buddhism.frequent features of taoist shrines include the same features as full temples, often including any or all of the following features: gardens, running water or fountains, small burning braziers or candles (with or without incense), and copies of taoist texts such as the tao te ching, zhuangzi or other texts by lao tzu, chuang tzu or other taoist sages."
"these temples are known as ""temples of confucius"" (孔廟) or ""temples of literature"" (文廟)."
"unlike taoist temples, confucian temples usually do not installed the images of confucius but the tablets."
the tablet or sometime an image of confucius is usually placed in the main shrine.
"however, many taoist temples dedicated a shrine for the worship of confucius or wen chang di jun (god of literature)."
busts or full-body statues are often erected and placed alongside each other in commemoration.
"small boats are typically found on inland waterways such as rivers and lakes, or in protected coastal areas."
"however, some boats, such as the whaleboat, were intended for use in an offshore environment."
"in modern naval terms, a boat is a vessel small enough to be carried aboard a ship.boats vary in proportion and construction methods with their intended purpose, available materials, or local traditions."
"canoes have been used since prehistoric times and remain in use throughout the world for transportation, fishing, and sport."
"circumstantial evidence, such as the early settlement of australia over 40,000 years ago, findings in crete dated 130,000 years ago, and in flores dated to 900,000 years ago, suggest that boats have been used since prehistoric times."
"motorboats, propelled by mechanical means, such as engines.a number of large vessels are usually referred to as boats."
"while a ship often has several decks, a boat is unlikely to have more than one."
"above the deck are often lifelines connected to stanchions, bulwarks perhaps topped by gunnels, or some combination of the two."
vertical structures dividing the internal spaces are known as bulkheads.
"fiberglass is also known as ""grp"" (glass-reinforced plastic) in the uk, and ""frp"" (for fiber-reinforced plastic) in the us."
since 1998 all new leisure boats and barges built in europe between 2.5m and 24m must comply with the eu's recreational craft directive (rcd).
"with the exception of courting individuals and mothers with their young, bears are typically solitary animals."
"bears have been hunted since prehistoric times for their meat and fur; they have been used for bear-baiting and other forms of entertainment, such as being made to dance."
"however, ringe notes that while this etymology is semantically plausible, a word meaning ""brown"" of this form cannot be found in proto-indo-european."
"according to author ralph keyes, this is the oldest known euphemism.bear taxon names such as arctoidea and helarctos come from the ancient greek ἄρκτος (arktos), meaning bear, as do the names ""arctic"" and ""antarctic"", via the name of the constellation ursa major, the ""great bear"", prominent in the northern sky.bear taxon names such as ursidae and ursus come from latin ursus/ursa, he-bear/she-bear."
"european genera morphologically very similar to allocyon, and to the much younger american kolponomos (about 18 mya), are known from the oligocene, including amphicticeps and amphicynodon."
"the raccoon-sized, dog-like cephalogale is the oldest-known member of the subfamily hemicyoninae, which first appeared during the middle oligocene in eurasia about 30 mya."
"in the mckenna and bell classification both bears and pinnipeds are in a parvorder of carnivoran mammals known as ursida, along with the extinct bear dogs of the family amphicyonidae."
prehistoric north and south american short-faced bears were the largest species known to have lived.
"they are sexually dimorphic with regard to size, with males typically being larger."
larger species tend to show increased levels of sexual dimorphism in comparison to smaller species.
"bears however have a single type of melanin and the hairs have a single color throughout their length, apart from the tip which is sometimes a different shade."
"while bears tend to be uniform in color, some species may have markings on the chest or face and the giant panda has a bold black-and-white pelage.bears have small rounded ears so as to minimize heat loss, but neither their hearing or sight are particularly acute."
"they are unique among carnivorans in not having touch-sensitive whiskers on the muzzle; however, they have an excellent sense of smell, better than that of the dog, or possibly any other mammal."
the sun bear's range extends below the equator in southeast asia.
"with their acute sense of smell, bears can locate carcasses from several kilometres away."
"however, all bears feed on any food source that becomes seasonally available."
"for example, asiatic black bears in taiwan consume large numbers of acorns when these are most common, and switch to ungulates at other times of the year.when foraging for plants, bears choose to eat them at the stage when they are at their most nutritious and digestible, typically avoiding older grasses, sedges and leaves."
"the sloth bear is not as specialized as polar bears and the panda, has lost several front teeth usually seen in bears, and developed a long, suctioning tongue to feed on the ants, termites, and other burrowing insects."
"typically, a bear plunges into the water and seizes a fish with its jaws or front paws."
"the brown bear and both species of black bears sometimes take large ungulates, such as deer and bovids, mostly the young and weak."
"large mammalian prey is typically killed by a bite to the head or neck, or (in the case of young) simply pinned down and mauled."
"predatory behavior in bears is typically taught to the young by the mother.bears are prolific scavengers and kleptoparasites, stealing food caches from rodents, and carcasses from other predators."
"bears sometimes communicate with visual displays such as standing upright, which exaggerates the individual's size."
this is usually accompanied by clawing and biting the object.
pandas are known to mark objects with urine and a waxy substance from their anal glands.
"a male bear may visit a female continuously over a period of several days or weeks, depending on the species, to test her reproductive state."
"gestation typically lasts 6–9 months, including delayed implantation, and litter size numbers up to four cubs."
"they usually follow her on foot, but sloth bear cubs may ride on their mother's back."
"since the invention of firearms, people have been able to kill bears with greater ease."
"by contrast, polar bears have few parasites; many parasitic species need a secondary, usually terrestrial, host, and the polar bear's life style is such that few alternative hosts exist in their environment."
bears in north america are sometimes infected by a morbillivirus similar to the canine distemper virus.
"public perception of bears is often positive, as people identify with bears due to their omnivorous diets, their ability to stand on two legs, and their symbolic importance."
"several bear species are dangerous to humans, especially in areas where they have become used to people; elsewhere, they generally avoid humans."
"injuries caused by bears are rare, but are widely reported."
"they have been trained to dance, and were kept for baiting in europe at least since the 16th century."
"ursa major has been associated with a bear for as much as 13,000 years since paleolithic times, in the widespread cosmic hunt myths."
"smokey bear has become a part of american culture since his introduction in 1944, with his message ""only you can prevent forest fires""."
"the international association for bear research & management, also known as the international bear association, and the bear specialist group of the species survival commission, a part of the international union for conservation of nature focus on the natural history, management, and conservation of bears."
